Permissions
-----------
Parameters
-----------
user_id - Reference to a user who is given a specific permission. If 0, this is default permission for users without specific permission.
Level - Integer that indicates level of power.
        0 - Creator Permissions, given by default to user who created the object
        1 - Read, Edit, Destroy permissions
        2 - Read, Edit permissions
        3 - Read only
        4 - No access
permissable_type - String with the name of the model of the type of Permission, created when permission is created from other model.
        e.g. perm.permissable_type == "Note"
permissable_id - Reference to the object that owns the permission.
        e.g. The id of the Note that the permission is referencing

----------
Setting up Model to be permissable
----------
in model
/app/models/note.rb
  has_many :permissions, as: :permissable, dependent: :destroy
Sets up a Note to have many permissions with permissable_type and id

in model_controller:
/app/controllers/notes_controller.rb - Lines 13-14
@perm_default = @note.permissions.create(user_id: 0, level: 3)
@perm_user = @note.permissions.create(user_id: current_user.id, level: 0)

Create the default permissions first (for notes, default behavior should be all users can see, but not edit or delete)
Then create the permission for user who is creating the note

in model_view
/app/views/notes/index.html.erb
<% if note.permissions.find_by user_id: current_user.id %>
<% perm = note.permissions.find_by user_id: current_user.id %>
<% else %>
<% perm = note.permissions.first %>
<% end %>

If, then else logic to detmien if the current user has a prespecified permission to accessing a note.
If the user has permission,
  then new permission is equal to his permission.
else
  new permission is equal to the default permission (the first permission for each model)
end

And then, we only display the note if the user has the permission to read it. We only display the edit button if
the user permission allows them to edit, and we only display the delete button if the user has the ability to delete it.


----------
Examples
----------

From app/views/notes/index.html:
<% House.find(current_user.relationship.house_id).notes.each do |note| %>
  <% if note.permissions.find(current_user).level < 4 %>

First we find all the notes in the house.
  If the note has a specific permission for that user, and that specifc permission is less than 4 (Contains Read access)
  OR if the default permission is less than 4
    then show the note.
  else
    display nothing
  end
